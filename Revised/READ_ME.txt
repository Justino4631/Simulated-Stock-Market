This is a revised version of the simulated stock market.

It allows you to set your initial money, as well as buy or sell different stocks.
By they way, to actually have it working, you should reset all the data in the second row of the
stock_data.xlsx doc. Then, run the Change_In_Excel_File.py file for a couple hours or even a day for accurate data, then run Operation_Handler.py.
